# Addressbook-management-by-using-c-programming
A simple C program that works like an address book. You can add, search, delete, and view contacts. The data is saved using file handling so it stays even after closing the program.
This project uses multiple C files to manage an address book.
main.c runs the program, contact.c/.h handle contact operations, and file.c/.h manage reading/writing data.
populate.c/.h load sample data.
Contact information is stored in contacts.txt and exported in contacts.csv.
